## Key phrases from the company
```
AlienVault OSSIM:
The World’s Most Widely Used
Open Source SIEM
```

```
OSSIM, AlienVault’s Open Source Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) product,
provides you with a feature-rich open source SIEM
complete with event collection, normalization and
correlation. Launched by security engineers because
of the lack of available open source products,
OSSIM was created specifically to address the reality
many security professionals face:
A SIEM, whether it is open source or commercial,
is virtually useless without the basic security controls
necessary for security visibility.

Our Open Source SIEM (OSSIM) addresses this reality
by providing one unified platform with many of the
essential security capabilities you need like:

    - Asset discovery
    - Vulnerability assessment
    - Intrusion detection
    - Behavioral monitoring
    - SIEM
