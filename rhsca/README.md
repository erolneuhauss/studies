# Learned so far
## Not only by this course but with all

### sudo
Rather than `sudo su -` use `sudo -i` (simulated initial login shell with environment variables)

### old cmd inline search and replace string in last command globally
`^foo^bar^:G`

### bash line editing
Type `fc` to edit your last command
`fc -s foo=bar`

### grep
`grep -w foo` respects word boundaries and omits `foobar`
