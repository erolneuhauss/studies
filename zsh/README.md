## Things That Makes Life SOOOO Much Easier!

### Create (nested) directory and change into it

```shell
mkdcd path/subpath
```

### Edit file

```shell
v lua
v deploy sh
```

Opens files with default editor

### Open a new terminal tab in same directory

```shell
tab
```

### Moar - a less alternative

```shell
p vaules.yaml
```

Opens file with pager (set to moar)

Another alternative is `bat`

```shell

```

### Search for aliases
